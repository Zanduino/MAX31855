@mainpage Arduino Library Header to access the MAX31855 thermocouple

@section MAX31855_intro_section Description

Class definition header for the Maxim MAX31855 Cold-Junction Compensated Thermocouple-to-digital
converter. The MAX31855 datasheet is located at
https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX31855.pdf and describes the relatively simple
interface.  The MAX31855 uses SPI to communicate and only outputs data. It writes a sentence of 32
bits which include device failure information, the ambient temperature and the thermocouple probe
temperature in degrees Celsius.\n\n

The most recent version of the MAX31855 library is available at
https://github.com/Zanduino/MAX31855 and the documentation of the library as well as example
programs are described in the project's wiki pages located at
https://github.com/Zanduino/MAX31855/wiki \n\n

The MAX31855 is a specialized chip that uses SPI to send a sentence of 32 bits on demand. This
contains the ambient temperature and probe temperature in degrees Celsius as well as some status
bits indicating fault conditions. It does not have any data inputs apart from checking the state of
the CS pin.

@section MAX31855doxygen doxygen configuration

This library is built with the standard "Doxyfile", which is located at
https://github.com/Zanduino/Common/blob/main/Doxygen. As described on that page, there are only 5
environment variables used, and these are set in the project's actions file, located at
https://github.com/Zanduino/MAX31855/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-doxygen.yml
Edit this file and set the 5 variables -  PRETTYNAME, PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_NUMBER, PROJECT_BRIEF
and PROJECT_LOGO so that these values are used in the doxygen documentation.
The local copy of the doxyfile should be in the project's root directory in order to do local
doxygen testing, but the file is ignored on upload to GitHub.

@section MAX31855clang clang-format
Part of the GitHub actions for CI is running every source file through "clang-format" to ensure
that coding formatting is done the same for all files. The configuration file ".clang-format" is
located at https://github.com/Zanduino/Common/tree/main/clang-format and this is used for CI tests
when pushing to GitHub. The local file, if present in the root directory, is ignored when
committing and uploading.
